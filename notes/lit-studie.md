### Train VUB corpus
Speech-to-text, also known as Speech Recognition, is a tech-
nology that is able to recognize and transcribe spoken language into text. In subsequent steps, this transcription can be used to complete a multitude of tasks, such as providing automatic subtitles or parsing voice commands

Started with DeepSpeech 

The ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence has managed to achieve unprecedented re-sults in the last couple of decades, across many ﬁelds, ranging from computer vision, e.g., beating human performance at the image recognition task, to reinforcement learning, e.g., achieving superhuman performance at the game of Go.

This work will take a closer look at another one of these ﬁelds, namely Speech-to-Text (STT), otherwise referred to as Speech Recognition (SR). Simply put, speech-to-text is the ability of a machine to “hear” spoken language and transcribe it

STT as a ﬁeld has many other practical applications, ranging from health-care and helping people with disabilities , to controlling military aircrafts. This potential societal impact makes STT an attractive research sub-
ject. 

for the future , This includes developing further techniques for handling noisy data, but also including other smaller datasets such at the one available through the Common Voice project. We are also interested in developing diﬀerent neural architectures and also using other frameworks such as PyTorch-Kaldi for this task.

### Malayalam speech to text
Speech is considered as the one of I. the common modes of communication among human beings in the 
modern civilized societies and it is the most natural and efficient way of exchanging information. It encourages numerous applications which includes a helping hand 
for illiterate individuals, support of telephonic directories, supervision gadgets for updating the health status in 
hospitals, in industrial banking sector etc. 

### deep learning approach for speech recognition
there are some languages or words that humans cannot easily
interpret, read, or decode to comprehend. As a result, it is critical to design and builds a
system that can analyze, comprehend, and generate human languages from given text. So, to
work on it, speech and language processing research allow computers to understand statements
written or spoken in human or natural languages

### multilangual speech tot text using deep learning
Current text and speech recognition and translation methods have a very low accuracy in 
translating sentences which contain a mixture of two or more different languages. The paper proposes a 
novel approach to tackling this problem and highlights some of the drawbacks of current recognition and 
translation methods. 

Multilingual translation and recognition is an important problem to tackle as there is a tendency for people 
to speak in a mixture of languages. By solving this problem, the barrier of language and communication 
can be lifted and thus can help people connect better and more comfortably with each other. 
-> the same idea can be applied to any language and their dialects
The general problems we need to tackle:
1. Recognizing that the sentence is a mixture of two or more languages

A popular speech and text recognition tool is the google api.
When using such API's the performance relies heavily on the language you are using. -> it will always try to map a word to the one that sounds the most similar in the language it is trained on.

### Development of the Speech-to-Text Chatbot Interface 
New speech recognition technologies and methods will become a central part of future life because they save a lot of communication time, replacing common texting with voice/audio.

### using speech to text tech to empower young people with special needs
As we can see in this study STT technology can also be used to help children with difficulties in spoken and written communication. The results showed that this approach
had boosted the quantity and quality of handwritten text, with post-test screen-written text significantly
better than handwritten at post-test. The self-esteem instrument also showed positive and statistically
significant results.
Writing difficulties are among the most common learning issues, affecting up to 15% of the school-age
population, and children who fail to develop developmentally appropriate writing skills are at a significant
disadvantage 
 using speech-to-text
(STT) technology may offer a means of circumventing transcriptional difficulties; children are able to
dictate, edit and review their work using voice commands as well as typing. The use of such systems is
intended not only to improve the quality and quantity of students’ communication of thoughts and ideas on
to a screen, but also to transfer this improvement to writing on paper.


### Applications in Healthcare:

The article highlights that speech-to-text conversion technology offers significant benefits in the healthcare sector. It emphasizes that this technology can reduce the time and cost of recording information in medical records.
Challenges in Medical Documentation:

The article discusses the limitations of traditional written documentation in healthcare, including issues like improper registration of data, illegibility, and invalid data. These limitations compromise the quality of medical records and can have serious consequences, such as documentation errors leading to patient harm.
Speech Recognition Technology's Role:

Speech recognition technology, as discussed in the article, addresses these challenges by providing an alternative means of documenting patient data. It allows healthcare providers, including doctors, to communicate with computer systems easily, reducing the need for manual transcription.
Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness:

The article emphasizes that speech recognition technology can significantly reduce the time needed to complete medical records, leading to improved productivity and reduced documentation costs. This has a positive impact on healthcare services' efficiency and the quality of patient care.
Acceptance and Challenges:

The article also acknowledges that there are challenges to the implementation of speech recognition technology in healthcare. Acceptance by healthcare providers, especially doctors, can be a potential barrier. Additionally, environmental factors, such as noise pollution, can affect the quality of sound recordings.
Future Prospects:

The article suggests that speech recognition algorithms and clinical vocabulary are expected to improve in the future, allowing the technology to understand natural languages better and make dictation more structured and efficient.
Incorporating these points into your literature study will provide insights into the application of speech recognition technology in healthcare, its benefits, and the challenges it faces. This can be a valuable addition to your research paper's discussion on STT technology's impact on healthcare.
